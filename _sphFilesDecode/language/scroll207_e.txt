TEXT

    In the year 5236 lord Stubborn built the Liege castle to guard the road from Bangville to Sheepstone from monsters. The towers of the castle were high, the walls strong, but it didn’t help the lord: the monsters captured and sacked the castle within four year. Since that time, the lord made several bids for the castle, but eventually the monsters once and again captured the Liege. The Liege castle can be found to west of the road leading to the north of Bagville.
