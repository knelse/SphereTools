100 A small bag or knapsack is the usual companion of a "novice" or a poorer traveler. It costs much less than the large bag of good workmanship, but it is less useful too. It is made of thick cloth and leather straps, so it is not deisgned for serious weights. A small bag can hold up to 8 different items, such as magic powder pouches, a helm, or a spare pair of boots. The bag has only one disadvantage - one cannot carry more than one on ones shoulders.
