03 Note to the Wayfarer

TEXT
    Greetings Wayfarer! You have found yourself in the realm of His Royal Majesty Arthur the Fifth, King of the Sphere, Duke of Charon, Ruler of the Six Continents. It is known to His Royal Majesty that you, wayfarer, have arrived from the lands that cannot be reached by our Glorious Kingdom.
    While you are in the Sphere and while you stay under the protection of any of the cities belonging to His Royal Majesty, you, wayfarer shall accept yourself a loyal subject of King Arthur the Fifth. In order not to disturb the peace of our good citizens you shall hire yourself a room in an inn.
    His Royal Majesty wishes you glorious victories in your battles against the monsters that arrogantly plagues His good subjects
