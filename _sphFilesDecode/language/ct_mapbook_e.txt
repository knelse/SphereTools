01 Book of maps
03 Book of maps
100 A long-long time ago when humans were still settling in the Sphere powerful mages of the time created the books of maps. As any other things created by the ancient magi these books also bear a trace of magic on them. Once one takes a book of maps, it will immediately open at the necessary page showing the traveler exactly those places where he is located at the moment, of course if the book has the map of these places at all. The books of maps were created such a long time ago, that their magic has now become commonplace and is not considered to be something miraculous. While the spell required for creating a book is now known not only to the magi, but to every map-trader. Nonetheless the book of maps has its downside too, one book cannot hold more than 20 maps.
