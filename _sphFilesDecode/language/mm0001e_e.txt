10100 If you have chosen the path of an Archimagician, don't expect it will be easy. To get the second stage in the guild you'll have to do away with %z1, a terrible monster which is practically invulnerable to physical attacks.
10101 However, a strong magician can overcome it. If you are a strong magician, go ahead. If you are not, there is no place for you in the second stage. %m1.

10200 Our guild has lots of enemies and the main duty of magicians in the third stage is to guard the supreme Archimagicians. You will be admitted only if you prove you can cope with our enemies.
10201 The first on our list are Steel Masters and Crusaders. They can't understand and therefore hate magic. If you bring me 10 ears of members of each of these guilds, you'll prove you can cope with them. 
10202 The Thieves guild plagues us constantly, stealing our mantras and other notes. I've found another their cache in a dungeon not far from here. Lots of documents are stored there that have been stolen from us. Go there and bring them to me. %m1.
10203 Those ignorant sorcerers should not be forgotten either. They dare to think that rendering magical properties to things is something supernatural. In fact, this occupation is just uninteresting to a real Archimagician. Bring this sword to %m2, head of the Sorcerers guild. I've personally rendered it magical properties they've never even dreamed about. %m1.

10300 No, don't ask me for the fourth stage! I am being ireful and totally unable to think about anything but this cheater %z1.
10301 %z1 is a well-known cave monster which can speak the language of Sphere. At night, it comes out of its dungeon to steal something. Unfortunately, it happened so that my unit was just riding by. They were carrying a very valuable article, the ancient Book of Four Elements written by the Weaver himself! It is now in the hands of %z1 and don't dream about promotion until we've regained it. Go to Hunter %m2 and find out where %z1 lives and how to trap it! %m1.
10302 You've come to the right man, %p1. I used to dream to get the head of %z1 for my collection and I know all about it. But, you know, hunters are not rich. No, I don't need money. Bring me some weapons and a little silver and gold to decorate them. %m2.
10303 Fine, I'll show you where %z1 is. Its cave is not far from here. Hope you'll manage to recover what has been stolen. %m2.
10304 The paltriest of disgusting humans! What have you achieved by killing me? The Book of Elements is not here all the same: I've given it to my brother, %z2. %z1.
10305 Well, finally I've got the Book. Now deliver this letter to %m3, and you can be admitted to the fourth stage in the guild. %m1.

10400 A very odd event occurred recently. The Great Archimagician %a1 was going to conduct some experiments in his tower. Shortly after he started, a blast occurred which destroyed the tower and all around it, too. Sure enough, we all are sad about the premature death of %a1. As a matter of fact though, I am more interested in those secrets he hid in his tower. 
10401 Go there and find out everything you can. Looters have worked there already, but the tower basement is well preserved and no one's been there, as it is full of vermin. If you find something interesting, bring it here soon. %m1.
10402 Hum, %a1's dairy. Let's ready it. Oh, very interesting. %a1 writes here about three artifacts that were in the tower and are now in the hands of looters, as it seems. The first is the elixir of life. We are lucky, as %a2, the man who stole it from the tower ruins, is currently in the prison of Inquisitors for some other crime. Get him out of there and take the elixir. Perhaps, he will tell you something about the other two articles or perhaps I'll know something myself. %m1.
10403 Eh, well, sure. Thank you for getting me out of there! Inquisitors are not too hospitable. Take the elixir, I don't actually need it, just took it because the bottle is nice. Anything else? Yeah, I saw a strange skull and an unusual shining stone carried away from there, but I won't share information with you for nothing. Don't forget that I am chased by Inquisitors and I need a shelter. %m2 helps guys like me go into hiding, but his prices match the king's funds. Bring him half a million thalers and don't forget a receipt. Show it to %m3 later, he holds a senior office in our guild of Thieves. He will tell you about those who stole the other two artifacts. But remember, I'll warn him not to talk to you without the receipt from %m2. %a2.
10404 %a2 has got into a scrape again? Poor rascal! All right, I'll help him this time. Give me the money and take the receipt. %m2.
10405 Welcome, %p1! %a2 warned me of your coming and gave me the name of the two Thieves who took the other artifacts. I've found out where they keep the stolen and drafted a map for you using your allegedly secret language of Archimagicians. What, you haven't yet learned it? Then go to your mentor, %m1, he'll translate. %m3.
10406 Well, these Thieves are really resourceful as regards caches! The mysterious skull was given to %b1, a God's fool wandering through Sphere forests, so that she keep it. Find her and take away the skull. %m1.
10407 The last article, the strange shining stone, was placed inside monster %z1. Destroy it and bring me the stone. You've done plenty of running these days, but once you've done away with %z1, the fifth stage in the guild will be a nice reward for you.

10500 This happened about ten years ago. For a long time, we had tried to conceive the secrets of transformations Barbarians and Druids are capable of. Our years of studies were crowned with success, but the next day the lab of the supreme Archimagician was attacked. All our work, including the key article, the Ring of Transformations, was stolen by the unknown robbers. We currently know nothing about the Ring, save for the name. In order to obtain the sixth stage in the guild, you must render us a really great service. I will only consider it a great service if the guild is saved from destruction which currently doesn't threaten us or the Ring is returned to us together with secrets of transformation. 
10501 First of all, learn about the Ring from those who have some understanding in them. Sure, these are blacksmiths. That ring is reported to have the brand of %a1. Go to him and try to find out something. Take this letter of recommendation which says you act on behalf of our guild. %m1.
10502 Old %a1 has not worked here for a long time. When he went crazy, I bought his smithy and I now work here. They say a great magician obscured his mind when he made some super-valued artifact. %a1 is till alive, but he won't be of any use to you. He is often seen wandering in the forests not far from here. He almost don't speak, but his mind rumored to become clear when he is near powerful magical articles and then he speaks about that Ring of Transformation. %m2.
10503 Ah, %z1! You won't get anything from me! This secret will die with me!!! : Ah: who?.. Friend, %m3! You better hide my notes. When I come for them, I'll show you this sword for you to know that's me, not a villain who's turned into me: %z1!!! Die, monster!... %a1.
10504 Yes, we were once friends with %a1 and he gave me some of his notes to keep and give them to the one who shows me the sword you've brought. Unfortunately, they are in my old cellar in which gangs of vermin have been bossing for several years. It won't be easy to get them. As far as I remember, they are coded with an ancient cipher of Archimagicians, so you'd better bring them to your mentor in the guild, he will be able to understand them. %m3.
10505 Excellent, %p1! You nearly deserve promotion in the guild. Little is to be done: learn about that %z1 whom %a1 talked about and find the Ring, as the notes I have deciphered indicate it is the central element of all transformations and experiments are impossible without it. %z1 sounds like the name of a monster, so we need a Hunter's help. We put one of them into a dungeon recently, because he'd poached in our forests. I think if you set %a2 free, he will be glad to help you find out who is %z1. %m1.
10506 %p1, my dear friend, I'll never forget what you've done for me! I thought I'd die in this gloomy dungeon. What? You are interested in %z1? At the Hunters school we were told about it as one of the most dangerous monsters in Sphere. It knows the magic of transformation and it's devilishly strong. But I am sure you can handle it. %z1 dwells in the woods not far from here. %a2.
10507 Why have you killed me, Archimagician? I've served your guild faithfully. I've always obeyed the orders of master %m4, for the glory of the Guild! I am dying having fulfilled my duty. %z1.
10508 Finally, the ring is ours. We can proceed with our experiments with the magic of transformations. However, those strange words %z1 uttered when dying give me no rest. We must find out who this %m4 is whose orders %z1 obeyed. I'll know it using one simple spell, but it requires a lot of alchemical elements. Bring me them and be sure not to make a mistake! %m1.
10509 I've found out who %m4 is! Many years ago the head of our guild had a student. This would have been a brilliant Archimagician, but, drawn by greed, he betrayed his master and was banished from the guild. His name was forgotten and even all notes about him where removed from our archives. This happened a little earlier than the incident with the Ring. Apparently, %m4 was aware of the experiments with the Ring and so he revenged on us. It is time he pay for everything. Destroy him and occupy your deserved place in the sixth stage of the Archimagicians guild! %m1.
