100 The great book of mantras or a grimoire, as it is often called by the magi, is a magic spellbook. As many other books in the Sphere, it is related to its master in a special way, that is, once a mage learns or makes up a new spell, it will immediately appear in the book. With the help of a grimoire a mage can remember and use a great number of spells, but in case he loses or gives his book of mantras away to someone, he will immediately lose all his magic power and will not be able to cast even a most simple spell. They say that the most powerful magi can copy the secret writings of their magic books onto a specially designed parchment or even plain paper. This is how they make the magic scrolls that are often used by common people, who know nothing about magic. As any other magic book a grimoire can hold only up to 16 black or white mantras.
