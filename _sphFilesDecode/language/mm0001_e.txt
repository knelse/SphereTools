10000 -Revenge %m1а- While I was on a business trip, terrible %z1, the spiteful monster who has destroyed quite a few settlements on Hyperion, attacked my house. What I have been saving all my life was destroyed. All that is left to me is revenge and I will be generous to the one who brings me the head of %z1, I swear, or I am not %m1!
10001 It is not easy to find the monster, but a friend of mine, %m2, knows a lot of magical secrets and has often assisted in searching for people lost in the forests of Hyperion. I'll give you a letter to him and his is sure to help you find the monster. %m1.
10002 Oh, a letter from the old friend! Sure, I can find anyone! I don't often have to search for monsters though. I am short of some alchemical elements.: Bring them to me and I'll find the one you need. Here's the list. %m1.
10003 Woe is me, this place is becoming more and more dangerous! While you were searching for the alchemical components, my lab was attacked by robbers! They took my notes and abducted my assistant, %a1! Fortunately, I still have some elixirs and I have found out he is confined in a dungeon not far from here. Rescue him because I cannot help you without my assistant. %m2.
10004 Thank you, you have rescued my assistant, but I am powerless without my notes: Wait, there is still some hope! My archives are stored in a distant dungeon on Hyperion. Bring them to me and we'll know where the monster! %m2.
10005 Well, the monster's found! %z1 has long plagued us with all his outrages. Bring his head and %m1 will reward you. %m2.

10100 -Blacksmith %m1- Listen, good %p1, what my sorrow is. My only nephew, %b1, was on her way here back from a long journey with a merchant caravan when robbers attacked them! They say many merchants were killed, but many still escaped and hid in forests. I hope %b1 is among those who managed to save themselves! If you find her, you will know the true gratitude of a blacksmith magician and %i1 in addition! %m1.
10101 Eyewitnesses prompted me where the attack was carried out, so if you have a map I'll mark this place. Good luck, %p1! %m1.
10102 Thank you for helping me, %p1! Take this letter to my uncle, %m1, for him to know I am all right. And please accept a gift - this small ring to remember me. %b1.
10103 Well, traveler, I'll who you my gratitude as I promised! You are lucky: I am the best blacksmith in these parts. My magical swords are famous on all continents in Sphere! I will forge you a wonderful weapon, but you will have to obtain some components. It is impossible to get them in this city... Here, these metals are required for the base of the magical weapon. %m1.
10104 In order for the weapon to be really durable, I need a tooth of %z1. This monster is already nearly 3,000, but its eye is as sharp, its hearing is keen and its teeth are strong. The best swords in Sphere are made of those famous teeth, including the king's! To be sure, in such circumstances %z1 has almost run out of its teeth, so get ready for trouble. But be sure, you won't have a good weapon without a tooth of %z1. %m1.
10105 I'm happy to please you: the base of the weapon is ready, we just have to add a little magic! Here, I use these plants in my magical broth. Twelve generations in our family have passed its secret from father to son. Bring me these plants and the artifact is yours! %m1.

10200 -Kitchen garden %m1а- There's a goat in my kitchen garden, a.k.a. %z1. That asshole's gorged all my cabbage. I need to get rid of it. I see you are wearing a sanitary service badge, so get started. Money?! Forget about it! It's your duty! My name is %m1, not stupid!
10201 What are you waiting for, %z1 is right in the kitchen garden now. Hit the little ass! I've shown the way on the map. %m1.
10202 Hum, I see you are good at fighting various vermin. You seem to be the right person to assign a seriuos task to. Listen carefully: I used to have an underground store on Hyperion. I say used to have because hordes of vermin are now bossing there. Sure, you cannot have back what used to be in the warehouse... However, my income book remains there in the bookkeeper's room. If it comes to the wrong hands, it will turn out that I must pay 500,000 thalers to the treasury or the King's wrath will smite me. Sure, I am not going to pay that money. So bring my my book and you'll get 100,000 thalers. Move, %p1, and don't tell anyone about that. %m1.

10300 -Careless %a1- Welcome, I am %m1, head of the merchant guild in this city. Imagine, my slave spilt ferengon petal wine on me at the dinner yesterday! Why, it won't wash off at all! Sure, I couldn't let such impudnece go unpunished. I wanted to hang him, but he ran away and hid at his aunt %b1's, in the basement. %a1 must be punished and I won't spare anything to see him breathless!
10301 This basement is well-known in the city, a real labyrinth full of monsters and traps! I wouldn't like to send my warriors for certain death there, so a fortune hunter like you comes in handy. Bring %a1 to the exit, my warriors will be waiting there, and you will get 1,000 standard units in thalers at the Sphere Central Bank rate on that day! I give you my word! %m1.
10302 Please, don't give me up to the guards of this monster %m1! Can the famous %p1 really be just an associate of murderers? Yes, I know %m1 promised pretty money for my head, but I'll tell you how to earn much more! Bring this sign to %m2 and you will learn the secret way to a cave where a great artifact, %i1, is stored! %a1.
10303 Well, you are telling me %a1 has sent me a message? Seems to be true... Well, %p1, I'll show you the way to the artifact known as %i1. It is stored in a very dangerous dungeon as are many in the expanses of Hyperion. But that's probably the most dangerous one, as terrible %z1 hides there! But the treasure it guards is worth all dangers. I think you are the hero whose destine is to possess it! %m2.
      
10400 Welcome, %p1! Time is coming... new time... that was prophesized long ago... I have some pages of an ancient scripture that can shed light on what is going on today. I am too old already, my eyesight is poor for me to read the text. I am ready to share the letters with you if you bring me the heart of a dragon!
10401 Well, a dragon is no friend to a hero, as they say, so you'll have to work hard to get the heart. Remember that your weapons cannot hurt it. But don't despair, I am old and blind though, but I am still able make a sword that can pierce its skin! I need some blood of three great dragons that lived on Tantal in ancient times and put the fear of God in entire Hyperion. The first dragon's blood is kept in the grave of the hero that killed it, deep underground, guarded by evil creatures. But I believe you can handle them. Good luck! %m1.
10402 Fine! The ice is broken. I know for sure that %a1, the last successor of a great dragon hunter, owns the second dragon's blood. His family has lately grown poor and, to the best of my knowledge, he is currently in a debtor's prison... However, he keeps all family valuables, including the dragon's blood. I think %a1 will give it to you if you have him out and tell him what you need it for. %m1.
10403 Thank you, %p1! I have lost hope someone will come to rescue me! What are you saying? You are going to get a dragon's heart? I hate those nasty creatures and will be glad to help you! Here! Bring it to %m1 as soon as possible. Die dragons! %a1.
10404 Yes! This is exactly what I need! There is one component left, and I will be able to make the weapon for you. I was told a local collector, %m2 by name, has the third dragon's blood. He is rumored to be unaware of what kind of treasure he owns, so if you talk to him in the right manner, you will get the dragon's blood at actually no cost. %m1.
10405 I've been going to throw away this phial as unwanted stuff! Can't figure out why you need it... I am a collector and a trader though, but I will give it you for free. %m2.
10406 Fine, all the 3 components are here and here is you sword. There's little to be done. Find a dragon and bring me its heart! Remember, the dragon can only die of this sword! Hope to see you again. %m1.
10407 Fine, all the 3 components are here and here is you sword. There's little to be done. Find a dragon and bring me its heart! Remember, the dragon can only die of this sword! Hope to see you again. %m1.

10507 What are you bringing me?! Didn't I ask you to bring me a dragon's heart! It's the only thing that extends my life... Hum, the key seems to be magical! Here, take it, I've rubbed it clean and it has recovered its magical properties. It's 10,000 thalers for you. What? You don't have such money? Just sign the receipt then. %m1.

11206 Fine, all the 3 components are here and here is you sword. There's little to be done. Find a dragon and bring me its heart! Remember, the dragon can only die of this sword! Hope to see you again. %m1.
11207 What are you bringing me?! Didn't I ask you to bring me a dragon's heart! It's the only thing that extends my life... Hum, the key seems to be magical! Here, take it, I've rubbed it clean and it has recovered its magical properties. It's 10,000 thalers for you. What? You don't have such money? Just sign the receipt then. %m1.

11900 Welcome, %p1! Time is coming... new time... that was prophesized long ago... I have some pages of an ancient scripture that can shed light on what is going on today. I am too old already, my eyesight is poor for me to read the text. I am ready to share the letters with you if you bring me the heart of a dragon!
11901 Well, a dragon is no friend to a hero, as they say, so you'll have to work hard to get the heart. Remember that your weapons cannot hurt it. But don't despair, I am old and blind though, but I am still able make a sword that can pierce its skin! I need some blood of three great dragons that lived on Tantal in ancient times and put the fear of God in entire Hyperion. The first dragon's blood is kept in the grave of the hero that killed it, deep underground, guarded by evil creatures. But I believe you can handle them. Good luck! %m1.
11902 Fine! The ice is broken. I know for sure that %a1, the last successor of a great dragon hunter, owns the second dragon's blood. His family has lately grown poor and, to the best of my knowledge, he is currently in a debtor's prison... However, he keeps all family valuables, including the dragon's blood. I think %a1 will give it to you if you have him out and tell him what you need it for. %m1.
11903 Thank you, %p1! I have lost hope someone will come to rescue me! What are you saying? You are going to get a dragon's heart? I hate those nasty creatures and will be glad to help you! Here! Bring it to %m1 as soon as possible. Die dragons! %a1.
11904 Yes! This is exactly what I need! There is one component left, and I will be able to make the weapon for you. I was told a local collector, %m2 by name, has the third dragon's blood. He is rumored to be unaware of what kind of treasure he owns, so if you talk to him in the right manner, you will get the dragon's blood at actually no cost. %m1.

12300 Просьба Деда Мороза.
12301 %p1, я очень устал и моё горло пересохло от жажды, принеси мне пожалуйста водички попить. Моя дочка Дарья поможет тебе найти воду, она должна быть у лесного озера. Вот записка для нее.
12302 О приветик, %p1, не ожидала тебя тут увидеть. Говоришь, мой отец послал тебя ко мне? К сожалению, я не могу дать тебе водицы, случилась беда, %z1 испортил всю воду в моём озере. Умоляю тебя, %p1, пойди и найди этого гада, возможно у него есть какое-то противоядье. Я кажется догадываюсь где он скрывается.
12303 Беда, Беда на всех вас, ты победил меня но это не сойдет тебе с рук... Спасибо, что не стал добивать меня, за это вот тебе противоядье, так и быть отдам тебе его, оно и исцелит воду от заразы. Отнеси его этой девчонке.
12304 О спасибо, %p1, это то, что нужно, теперь вода исцелена от яда. К несчастью, пока ты ходил в подземелье, разбойники украли мою сестру Медарью. Я слышала - разбойники говорили, что они собираются пойти на Тантал. Пожалуйста, найди её и проведи к выходу на острове Тантал, рядом с селением. Поторопись, её могут убить.
12305 Спасибо, что привел меня к выходу. Мои родственники живут на острове Тантал. Ты найдешь там мою знакомую Светлану, поговори с ней.
12306 Спасибо, что помог Медарье добраться до селения, она бы сама точно не справилась. От одного моего хорошего знакомого мага я слышала, что недавние нападения монстров на города происходят по вине некоего мага-отшельника Де Владоса, да да именно его! Помниться его изгнали с позором из гильдии за какой-то проступок. С тех пор он стал проводить ужасные эксперименты, говорят, что он даже пытался писать на форуме и изменить свою сущность, стать великим драконом. Найди его и разберись с ним, потом приходи ко мне. Ах да, ищи его на Хароне, в районе Йонга.

12308 %p1, теперь твоя молодецкая удаль известна всем, но, помнится, ты хотел принести водички старику Деду Морозу. На, держи вот, неси воду ему. Он, надеюсь, одарит тебя чем-нибудь. Ах да, чуть не забыла, говорят, что в Сфере стали появляться удивительные бусинки, принеси три бусинки Деду, порадуй старика, он, помнится, спрашивал у меня про них.

12400 %p1, золотце моё, у бабушки закончились все припасы для колдовства, а зима намечается суровая. Говорят, что месяц назад на земле стали появляться удивительные бусинки, уж не знаю, связано ли это как-то с ритуалами увеличения опыта или нет, но соседка мне сказала, что эти бусинки уж больно хорошо усиливают прок от заклинаний. Прошу тебя собери мне побольше бусинок и немного припасов на зиму, а я тебя уж вознагражу чем-нибудь вкусненьким.
12401 Соберите необходимые вещи, чтобы получить награду.

12500 Приветствую! Кажется, я тебя где-то уже видел. Ну ладно, к делу. Ректор Де Брейл, глава гильдии магов, поручил мне, в срочном порядке, исследовать животных этого мира. Никак не могу понять, откуда такая срочность! Самому мне никак с этим не справиться и поэтому я прошу тебя, принеси мне волчий хвост, пару жал скорпионов и чешую тифона, в долгу не останусь!
12501 Соберите необходимые вещи, чтобы получить награду.

12600 Если ты говоришь со мной, %p1 - твоя смелось и сила не знает границ, а иначе нам нечего обсуждать! На днях король Катун подписал указ, что всякий, кто принесет доказательства победы над драконом и другими более мелкими тварями, получит награду от Его величества. Так же в указе значится, что нужно принести еще несколько штук неких магические частиц, в простонародье бусинок, но это для тебя не проблема, ты найдешь их по дороге к дракону. Я могу выдать тебе награду, но только если ты принесешь мне необходимые вещи. Желаю удачи, %p1!
12601 Соберите необходимые вещи, чтобы получить награду.

13000 Поздравим Вас мы с праздником мужчин,<br>Что в двадцать третье февраля все вместе отмечаем!<br>Ведь это день защитников страны,<br>И мы Вам, от души, всего всего желаем!<br><br>Подарок буду рада я отдать<br>Коль соберёшь магическое слово.<br>А буквы для него нужно искать,<br>У мобов, всем давно уже знакомых.
