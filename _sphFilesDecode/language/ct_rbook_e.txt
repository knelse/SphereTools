100 The book of recipes is the main book in the life of an alchemist. As many other books in the Sphere this magic book is related to its master in a special way. Whatever mysterious concoction he brews in his alchemic pot, the book will alll by itself remember to write down the ingredients and the result of the reaction. It has been like that since forever. The thing is that alchemic experiments are not in any way safe and this is whyb sometimes only a torn or burnt book of recipes could hint to the students and colleagues about the fate of the unfortunate mage. One should remember though that a book of recipe can hold only up to 20 different notes - this number is determined by the amount of magical power put into the book by its creator.
