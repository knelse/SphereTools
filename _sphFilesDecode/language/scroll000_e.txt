TEXT
    Centuries ago the Sphere had a developed banking systems, and banking couriers would fly between the cities using magic and carrying different values. The reputation of the Courier Clan was extremely high. But then once a merchant, one of the richest people of the time, decided to move from Bangville to Sheepstone. To ensure his own security he hired the flying couriers. But the robbers of the Noseless found out about this and attacked the caravan. Noseless managed to use some magic that was no less strong than the magic of the couriers. All robbers and many couriers perished in the battle; the larger part of treasures lay scattered across the rocks below. The treasures are still searched for by bounty hunters. But they are thwarted by the ghosts of the dead couriers, who are flying above the rocks determined to fulfill their duty and guard the treasure. The flying skeletons would not appear every time, so one has a chance to find something valuable without running into them. If they do appear use an incense stick for driving the ghosts away and your own sword.

    Nylus of Nomrad, Historian of His Royal Majesty Leon the Second, King of the Sphere, Duke of Charon, Ruler of the Six Continents.
