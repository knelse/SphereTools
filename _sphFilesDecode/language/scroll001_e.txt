03 Manuscript of Fern

TEXT
    Over a 1,000 years ago, when the Sphere was not yet on the verge of destruction, there was the so-called Hall of the Remaining. In essence the Hall was a magic school, where the most capable students would study the Higher Art of Magic. The Master of the Hall was considered the strongest mage of all the Remaining and the Leaving until the 6801 Bangville Battles of Magi when the Leaving inflicted severe damage upon the member of the Hall. 
    However long before the battle, in 6250, there happened a very unpleasant incident in the Hall. Back at the time the post of the Master was occupied by Noviz, famed for his rare skill of invisibility. One of Noviz’s closest assistants Rester decided to take over the Master’s position. Using magic and selection he developed a new sort of fern, which, when used in certain reaction with quartz, would develop a Magic Eye that allowed to see the unseen. Rester wanted to use the Eye against Noviz in the annual Combat of Magic that was held between the Master of the Hall and 13 younger masters. Normally the procedure was a mere formality, since the position of the High Master presupposed access to the ingredients and books that were not available to  the Master’s inferiors. Over the past 10 years Noviz would always use his invisibility trick and become the victor.
    Indeed during the battle Rester managed to reveal the invisible figure of Noviz, deprive him of his advantage and win. Rester stayed in the post for three years, gaining monopoly over both the invisibility and revealing magic. But he had made a mistake: the precious fern, whose shoots were extraordinarily enduring, grew over the fence into the neighboring gardens and all over the nearby forests. Rester had no idea about this, and then three years later to his great surprise during the annual combat Noviz used the magic of revealing and won his title and position back. 
    The remaining part of his long life Rester devoted to exterminating the fern and in this he succeeded  quite a bit: the magic fern is extremely rare in the Sphere these days and even if one finds it, it would be very hard to tell it from regular ferns. It is only once a month during the full moon that the gleaming flower would betray the fern. Aside from being a part of the magic reaction of revealing the fern-flower would help the souls lost in illusions see their real position. Which is why when blooming the rare fern-flowers are surrounded by various creatures, many of them not-too-friendly ones. 
    There is a simple alchemic recipe with Rester Fern: 
    Put the fern-flower together with a quartz crystal and complete the reaction with Faynal powder.
