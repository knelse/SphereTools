10100 Remember, %p1, a real master armorer spends time not only in his workshop. In order to get a really rare article, you'll have to walk lots of miles in Sphere in search of alchemical components.
10101 In order to obtain a stage in our guild, you'll have to show what you are able of. Here is a formula using which you can make %i1. If you can do it, you'll get the second stage in the guild of Armorers. As you can see, the components are extremely rare, but I know you'll make it.

10200 Our craft is very complex and sometimes components for weapons are very strange. I am just making a very unusual sword and I need a couple of special components for it. If you bring them to me and don't confuse anything, I'll recommend you to the Council of Elders for getting the third stage in our guild.
10201 The first is the Bangville toadstool. It grows only in dungeons, but by no means in every one: Its appearance is somehow linked with monsters, so it's never easy to obtain it. %m1.
10202 The second is an ancient roll that my friend %m2 keeps. Take this letter and he'll give you the roll. %m1.
10203 Can it be so, old chap %m1 has remembered about me! He must be in need of something. The roll? Sure, sure: Ah, %m1 as usual forgot to mention I am not engaged in charity. The ancient roll is an expensive thing and I won't sell it at less than 150,000 thalers! %m2.
10204 Fine, my sword will be the best on the continent! You've done well%s1, %p1, and you can quite reckon on my recommendation to get the third guild. Take this book, this is the charter of our guild, flip it through, sign the last page and give it back to me. A routine, it can't be helped. %m1.

10300 You've mastered%s1 the art of making simple articles quite well, %p1. However, it's obviously insufficient to obtain the fourth stage in the guild. No way: but perhaps an exception will be made for you if you do a service to the Council of Elders.
10301 The daughter of a Council member recently got lost in the forests of our continent. This place swarms with dangerous monsters, but prophets from among magicians assure %b1 is still alive. Find her and bring her to the nearest portal. %m1.
10302 Thank you, %p1, you've saved my life! My father and I owe you and we will certainly help you to get the fourth stage in the guild. I've written a letter that I am all right. When %m1 reads it, he will render you all possible assistance. %b1.
10303 Did she really say "all possible assistance"? It looks like %b1 has forgotten I am not almighty and only one Council member out of ten is on your side. But probably we can gain some more vote. The matter is %m2 owes a large amount to five of our elders and has made off from the city. Apparently, it is impossible to bring him here, while the Council does not approve of murder. But you are strong enough to beat the obligation out of him for his relative to pay the elders under it. %m1.
10304 Okay, okay! Don't touch me, I'll write you an obligation. Go bring it to this robber %m1. %m2.
10305 Fine, most Council members are with us, but you'll still have to pass the exam. Here is a formula with quite rare components. Make the article indicated there and bring it to me. The fourth stage in the guild is then yours. %m1.

10400 You want to get the fifth stage in the guild? It's all simple: prove your ability and get the stage.
10401 It has come time when the secret of how our formulas are made may be entrusted to you. To begin with, let's make the base. Here is a list of components, bring them to me so that we can start. %m1.
10402 So, the base is ready. Our formulas are practically eternal because we use the blood of a special type of nyphons instead of ink. You'll find one of them, %z1, over there. %m1.
10403 Master %p1: You've won over me in an honest battle and I'll disclose you the secret of the one who's sent you here, for my ruin: In a far-away dungeon, my friend %a1 keeps several letters written by %m1 to the heads of enemy guilds. If you are able to obtain them and give them to your guild's Council of Elders, the traitor %m1 will meet his deserts!.. Do it for the well-being of your guild and the peace of my soul: %z1.
10404 Did he call me his friend? Why, I was just his captive meant for telling him fairy-tales long nights in Sphere! But now I hope I am free? Here, take these letters %z1 talked about, I no longer need them. I recommend that you bring them to %m2, head of your guild. %a1.
10405 Damn traitor %m1! I knew some one of us sold himself to our enemies, but I didn't think it was him. However, we need incontestable evidence. %m1 has many patrons in the Council and if he claims the letters are forged, some can side with him. Bring this letter to %m3, while I'll be searching for additional proofs, he is the oldest Council member and his presence is necessary. By the way, forget all fairy-tales %m1 told you about how our formulas are made. This was just a ground for you to kill %z1, a friend and protector of our guild. %m2.
10406 Fine, I'll come to the Council, but the road there is long and dangerous. Be so kind, go to my basement and find there my old sword among other stuff. Bring it to me and I'll be ready for the trip. %m3.
10407 While you were there, %m2 has sent a new assignment for you. A witness is required to expose %m1. We won't find a live witness, so you'll have to bring an ear of some Blacksmith, better from the leadership of their guild, who knows about %m1's treason. Using the ear, the Council will call the Blacksmith's spirit and I hope it'll be able to testify. Here's a string, don't waste time. As soon as you get the ear, bring it to %m2. Besides, we've consulted each other and decided that you quite deserve the fifth stage in our guild after this task. %m3.

10500 A great danger threatens us all! Terrible monster %z1 has obviously been sent to us by enemy guilds. It kills our masters one after another and it's invulnerable to any or our weapons. However, our spirit is unshakable and the Council of Elders has created the formula of a new weapon that can penetrate any magical protection. It's called %i1.
10501 This is the most responsible assignment ever given to guild members, so don't be offended that the Council wants to put you to test. The dungeon used as our guild's warehouse was recently seized by vermin with %z2 at the head. Destroy it and you'll prove you're not only a great master, but also a valiant warrior and then I'll also be able to entrust the formula to you and the destiny of our guild. %m1.
10502 Fine, %p1, you've proved%sx your military abilities. I hope your abilities in our craft are no worse. If so, you'll be able to make %i1. Take this letter and bring it to the head of the Council. His name is %m2 and he'll give you the formula and tell what to do next. %m1.
10503 Hello, brave master! The Council has heard a lot about your feats for the glory of our guild. Unfortunately, ill luck follows us. The formula was to be delivered to me yesterday, but the courier who carried it was attacked by robbers. %a1 is a quick messenger and good warrior, but he could do nothing. He is currently confined to a dungeon. Fortunately, the robbers don't surmise what kind of important message he was carrying. Set him free as soon as possible and learn what happened to the formula. %m2
10504 Thank you, %p1, I owe you. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to deliver the formula on time.: I hope, %m2 won't condemn me for what I did. When I saw I was too tired and unable to escape the robbers, I gave the formula to a peasant I met and ordered him to run in the opposite direction. His name was %m3, that's all I had time to ask him about. Here's a letter with my coat of arms, he saw it and I hope he'll recognize it. Hurry up! %a1.
10505 Well, I do have the formula. However, I risked my life not for this blunderer %a1 to be able to redress his wrong before your Council. I need compensation for my pains, minimum 300,000 thalers! %m3.
10506 Take your formula. Go bring it to %m2 or whoever is your chief. I looked at it, but couldn't figure out anything, must be in cipher. %m3.
10507 Well, we have the formula. You wonder why I am not glad? I have to give you a sad assignment: Unfortunately, for the weapon to penetrate the magical protection that surrounds %z1, it must contain the very spirit of our guild, both of us among those who represent it. To save us all, one of us must be sacrificed. I think you are not planning suicide, so take this string and bring me an ear of a member of our guild. %m2.
10508 I'll prepare the spirit of the poor thing and for transfer to the weapon and it's time for you to show your mastership as armorer. Take the formula, I've deciphered it, and make %i1 according to what it indicates. %m2.
10509 Well, %p1, %i1 is ready. I've been able to invest the soul of the dead guildian into it. Bring me the head of %z1 and you'll get the sixth stage in our guild, be able to join the Council of Elders and know the secrets of making the strongest weapons.
