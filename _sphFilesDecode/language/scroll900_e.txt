    ...haven’t got there. But we could see him! The Nifon bridge - neither I no my friends could imagine such a terrible sight at the beginning of our campaign. The battle was swift, and if my eyes do not mislead me, some elect ones of my fellow travelers managed to pass that terrible bridge, that separates our detachment from the way to save your lord, Milady. But my forces were not enough to follow them. I turned back, Milady. A wondrous monster was chasing me off the mysterious island, and my body was stricken by terrible blows… I managed to deceive the terrible creature, but death is behind me and there never will be a time when I will be seeing you or your lord. Believe me, Milady, your people will walk over the island and your lord will be once again with you. If not this time, then the next detachment will be able to find a good way to Tantalus.
    Good Bye, Milady, let your days will be cheerful… it is written in the amount that I can now still bear. I still have the hope the news will reach you, Milady. I leave my notes to the will of the wind.
