10998 Our profession is very dangerous, %p1. You have to be dexterous and fearless to succeed.
10999 To get the second stage, you'll have to kill %z1, head of a local flock of flyers. %m1.

10100 Our profession is very dangerous, %p1. We need dexterity and fearlessness to succeed.
10101 To get the second stage, you'll have to kill the chief of a flock of flyers, %z1 by name. to win over a flyer, dexterity is required rather than power, so this is a good test for you. %m1.

10200 A capable thief should have lots of skills. Just stealing a thing is not enough, one should be able to sell it or hide it if selling is impossible.
10201 We'll take up a treasure-house not far from here. Its owner, %m2, is currently away and no one will interfere with you: no one save the hordes of vermin that dwell there. %m1.
10202 It would not be not bad to hide the packet to be on the safe side if you are suspected. I know an excellent dungeon. It is invaded by monsters with %z1 at the head. If you manage to get them out of there, you'd never found a better place for a cache. %m1.
10203 The goods you've stolen are not as easy to sell, while we don't need it. The best way out of this situation is to offer the stolen goods to their owner. Palm this letter with a ransom demand to %m2, but so that he doesn't see you! After that, let's think the task accomplished and third stage in the guild is yours. %m1.

10300 I'll give you an unusual task to get the fourth stage. I want you not to stole any trifles for me, but the soul of great %a1. This greatest thief in Sphere lived hundreds of years before us... Powerful magicians of that time, angry at his successes, gathered together and confined his soul to a precious stone.
10301 I am sure when we have the stone, we'll be able to talk to the %a1's spirit and learn how he managed such extremely difficult thefts. The stone is kept in the treasure-house of a collector not far from here; go there and get it for me! %m1.
10302 What ill luck! When you had left, I learnt the stone with %a1's soul was not to be touched by a Thief, or his soul would be released! Apparently, this is what happened, so %a1's soul is now wanders God knows where. Run to %m2 now, he is an excellent magician and he understands necromancy, he'll help us find %a1's soul. %m1.
10303 Good magic costs pretty money, %p1! Sure, I'll find %a1, but spending will be great. Apart from some plants, we'll need 20 scales of a typhon. By the way, don't forget about my fees, 2 million thalers. %m2.
10304 I've found that %a1's spirit has moved into %z1, a local monster. He is unlikely to be willing back into the stone, so get ready to fight. After that, you'll move to a new stage of mastership. %m2.
 
10400 Most guilds hate us and envy our wealth. Some openly persecute and destroy us. Crusaders plague us most, they have declared us equal to monsters of Sphere.
10401 Well, we weren't the first to attack, so any our actions will be justified. To start with, I would like you to destroy at least 30 Crusaders. This will be our diversionary blow, while we'll strike the key one properly, secretly and mercifully. %m1.
10402 Wonderful, %p1. While Crusaders were busy with you, I was able to obtain all information about the sword of courage, an ancient artifact and the greatest sanctuary of Crusaders. When we steal it, we'll make them enter into a peace agreement that will be favorable to us. The sword is guarded securely, but will solve the problem. Bring this sign to my first assistant, %m2. He will be your partner in this operation. %m1.
10403 Well, the job won't be easy! I've analyzed the situation and seen that the only way to obtain the sword is to narcotize the guards. I've agreed with a local alchemist, %m3. He will make us a potion for 1 million thalers that can narcotize the whole garrison. %m2.
10404 It's impossible to make a really strong potion without unique components. If you want to get a really strong elixir, we need the power of a magical creature, a Death Messenger. This powerful monster possesses the spell of sleep and its head will come in very handy. One Messenger, %z1 is right now not far from here. %m3.
10405 I've made the elixir, %p1! Now you task is to make sure that all the guards drink it. I recommend talking to their cook, %m4. Give him the potion and he'll know how to better use it. %m3.
10406 I'll help you if it is %m3 who's sent you, but only in exchange of a small service. My friend %a1 has been put to a dungeon by Crusaders, but he's been able to run away. He is currently wandering in fields and hiding from them, but this can't last eternally. Lead him to the nearest Teleport and protect on the way from Crusaders and other troubles. Meanwhile, I'll add your elixir to the guards' food. %m4.
10407 %a1 is safe and the guards are neutralized. We can go to the dungeon where the sword is stored. %m1 is dying to see it. %p1.

10500 To join the sixth stage of the guild of Thieves, you must commit not simply a theft, but a theft Sphere has seen never before and it must be useful to our guild in addition. We've long wished to get the Ring of Claw, an ancient artifact that enables its owner to take the shape of a cyanos.
10501 Just imagine how useful this ability would be in our work! However, it is not easy to obtain the Ring. To begin with, you should talk to its maker, his name is %m2. He is not especially fond of our guild members, so take this fake ID, you'll need it. %m2 won't tell it from real. %m1.
10502 Hello, %p1! Interested in the ring I made once? Yeah, that's a unique article. The customer was afraid of Thieves so much, so he took care to protect the ring beforehand. Apart from the fact that he built a special labyrinth with lots of traps, he asked me to embed a powerful spell in the ring itself for everyone who tries to take it without using a counter-spell to be killed. Besides, he hired %m3, the most experienced warrior in our parts, to guard it! By the way, last time I saw him a long time ago. I'd like to send him a message, but there's no one who'd take it... What? You are going just there? So bring him my letter, please. %m2.
10503 Yeah, I am chief of the Guards, %m3. What's there? A letter from an old friend! I'm so glad... So, you say you are a historian interested in old rings? Well, you've come from my friend, %m2, and I'll tell you about the Ring of Claw. You can't see it though, alas. Firstly, I don't want to risk my job and secondly, the Ring will kill anyone who touches it, save for the master. This is the spell imposed on it by %a1, a great wandering magician. He often wanders about local forests and plains in search of sources of magical energy such as Teleports. %m3.
10504 My body is filled with magical energy near Teleports: Thank you, %p1, for bringing me here. You are interested in the counter-spell for the Ring of Claw? It's quite simple, any mediocre alchemist, even the local charlatan %m4, can make you the elixir. Take this recipe and bring it to the alchemist. %a1.
10505 It's a double price with the customer's recipes. Besides, the components mentioned here are extremely rare, so you'll have to find them yourself. The list includes: kazadur, melvera and the powder of physical protection. And don't forget my half a million thalers for the job! %m4.
10506 Damn, this %a1 can't write at all. I've just deciphered the recipe reads at the end that all components must be boiled not in the simple solution of Amilus, but in the blood of %z1, a well-known monster. Find it or nothing will come out of it. %m4.
10507 The elixir is a little queer... It dissolves glass and even corrodes my alchemical furnace a little. Let alone usual pots. But it seems to be safe for living things, so I'll apply it to you and get rid of the remains. By the way, %p1, we've used a very strange recipe. Don't think I am as stupid as %a1 says I am. I know what this elixir is for. Don’t be afraid, I won't expose you. I have another plan. You'll get you ring and I'll solve my problems! You see, the master of the ring is reported to be a man who likes wonders of various sorts. A special monster, %z2, is confined to one of his dungeons. It's not like others of its type, but much stronger, eviler and more intelligent; he's even mastered human language. Unfortunately, it was captured in my house and it's a living proof that I did alchemical experiments on monsters, which the King of Sphere has banned downright. I've given you enough strength to destroy it. It has the ring, seize it and give it to your mentor %m1. %m4.
10508 Ha! What sort of Thief you are if you are stealing the Ring to give it to someone else... Not a thief, a servant running errands. Although you've been able to win over me, I am glad you won't get the prize for his victory! Well, basically, if I were you, I would order a duplicate of the ring from %m2 and kept the original. %z2.
10509 Aha, you're back %p1! How is your historic research? What? Make a copy of the ring for your collection... It's good you've brought a blank... Sure, sure... I can't render it magical properties, but it'll look just the same. %m2.
10510 So you say the ring has been subject to a charm and lost effect?.. Yes, it's strange indeed... But I believe you, this is that very ring, I've seen it hundreds of times in pictures. Well, the only thing to do to join the sixth stage of the guild is to pay the entrance fee, 1 million thalers. Hope you've had time to steal enough, ha ha. %m1.
