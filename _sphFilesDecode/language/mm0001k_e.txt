10100 Remember, %p1, a real master blacksmith spends time not only in his workshop. In order to get a really rare article, you'll have to walk lots of miles in Sphere in search of alchemical components.
10101 In order to obtain a stage in our guild, you'll have to show what you are able of. Here is a formula using which you can make %i1. If you can do it, you'll get the second stage in the guild of Blacksmiths. As you can see, the components are extremely rare, but I know you'll make it.

10200 Our craft is very complex and sometimes components for weapons are very strange. I am just making a very unusual sword and I need a couple of special components for it. If you bring them to me and don't confuse anything, I'll recommend you to the Council of Elders for getting the third stage in our guild.
10201 The first is the Bangville toadstool. It grows only in dungeons, but by no means in every one: Its appearance is somehow linked with monsters, so it's never easy to obtain it. %m1.
10202 The second is an ancient roll that my friend %m2 keeps. Take this letter and he'll give you the roll. %m1.
10203 Can it be so, old chap %m1 has remembered about me! He must be in need of something. The roll? Sure, sure: Ah, %m1 as usual forgot to mention I am not engaged in charity. The ancient roll is an expensive thing and I won't sell it at less than 150,000 thalers! %m2.
10204 Fine, my sword will be the best on the continent! You've done well%s1, %p1, and you can quite reckon on my recommendation to get the third guild. Take this book, this is the charter of our guild, flip it through, sign the last page and give it back to me. A routine, it can't be helped. And take this sword from me. This is one of my failed experiments, but it can be useful to you, at least as an exemplary specimen. %m1.

10300 You've mastered the art of making simple articles quite well, %p1. However, it's obviously insufficient to obtain the fourth stage in the guild. No way: but perhaps an exception will be made for you if you do a service to the Council of Elders.
10301 The daughter of a Council member recently got lost in the forests of our continent. This place swarms with dangerous monsters, but prophets from among magicians assure %b1 is still alive. Find her and bring her to the nearest portal. %m1.
10302 Thank you, %p1, you've saved my life! My father and I owe you and we will certainly help you to get the fourth stage in the guild. I've written a letter that I am all right. When %m1 reads it, he will render you all possible assistance. %b1.
10303 Did she really say "all possible assistance"? It looks like %b1 has forgotten I am not almighty and only one Council member out of ten is on your side. But probably we can gain some more vote. The matter is %m2 owes a large amount to five of our elders and has made off from the city. Apparently, it is impossible to bring him here, while the Council does not approve of murder. But you are strong enough to beat the obligation out of him for his relative to pay the elders under it. %m1.
10304 Okay, okay! Don't touch me, I'll write you an obligation. Go bring it to this robber %m1. %m2.
10305 Fine, most Council members are with us, but you'll still have to pass the exam. Here is a formula with quite rare components. Make the article indicated there and bring it to me. The fourth stage in the guild is then yours. %m1.
 
10400 You want to get the fifth stage in the guild? It's all simple: prove your ability and get the stage.
10401 It has come time when the secret of how our formulas are made may be entrusted to you. To begin with, let's make the base. Here is a list of components, bring them to me so that we can start. %m1.
10402 So, the base is ready. Our formulas are practically eternal because we use the blood of a special type of nyphons instead of ink. You'll find one of them, %z1, over there. %m1.
10403 Master %p1: You've won over me in an honest battle and I'll disclose you the secret of the one who's sent you here, for my ruin: In a far-away dungeon, my friend %a1 keeps several letters written by %m1 to the heads of enemy guilds. If you are able to obtain them and give them to your guild's Council of Elders, the traitor %m1 will meet his deserts!.. Do it for the well-being of your guild and the peace of my soul: %z1.
10404 Did he call me his friend? Why, I was just his captive meant for telling him fairy-tales long nights in Sphere! But now I hope I am free? Here, take these letters %z1 talked about, I no longer need them. I recommend that you bring them to %m2, head of your guild. %a1. 
10405 Damn traitor %m1! I knew some one of us sold himself to our enemies, but I didn't think it was him. However, we need incontestable evidence. %m1 has many patrons in the Council and if he claims the letters are forged, some can side with him. Bring this letter to %m3, while I'll be searching for additional proofs, he is the oldest Council member and his presence is necessary. By the way, forget all fairy-tales %m1 told you about how our formulas are made. This was just a ground for you to kill %z1, a friend and protector of our guild. %m2.
10406 Fine, I'll come to the Council, but the road there is long and dangerous. Be so kind, go to my basement and find there my old sword among other stuff. Bring it to me and I'll be ready for the trip. %m3.
10407 While you were there, %m2 has sent a new assignment for you. A witness is required to expose %m1. We won't find a live witness, so you'll have to bring an ear of some Armorer, better from the leadership of their guild, who knows about %m1's treason. Using the ear, the Council will call the Armorer's spirit and I hope it'll be able to testify. Don't waste time. As soon as you get the ear, bring it to %m2. Besides, we've consulted each other and decided that you quite deserve the fifth stage in our guild after this task. %m3.

10500 Welcome, %p1. You'll get the sixth stage in the guild of Blacksmiths, but only when you carry out my assignment. It concerns %m2, a skillful Blacksmith and the key supplier of alchemical components for our guild.
10501 Coming for alchemy, we've lately met strange creatures and mysterious people hiding their faces near %m2's house. %m2's disappeared the other day, his house is open and there are not marks of struggle. I can't imagine what this means, so your task is to find out everything about this case and find %m2 if he is still alive. To begin with, go to %m3, he is %m2's neighbor and might have seen something. %m1
10502 For a while now, the only thing %m2's talked abut was that he's found the secret of making some super-powerful artifact. I don't know what exactly he's made, he didn't tell me. Perhaps his student %a1 is informed, but he disappeared on the same night as %m2. People say though they saw %a1 running to the forest as if followed by devils. Perhaps, that's what it was. Anyway, your only chance to know what happened is to find him in the forest, bring him to safety, e.g. to a Teleport, and ask him about everything. %m3.
10503 Horrible monsters controlled by assassins and barbarians broke into our house that awful night. These two guilds will give anything to obtain the artifact %m2 was making. He was able to find the secret of the famous Ring of Invisibility, an ancient artifact of Sphere that was lost many years ago. Now Master is in their hands and I don't know what we can do. Perhaps, %m2's personal notes can help. They are stored in a far-away dungeon guarded by monsters. Bring them to %m1, he is wise and can advise us what to do next. %a1.
10504 The Ring of Invisibility! We must prevent it from getting in the hands of our age-old enemies, Assassins. Can you imagine what they can do while being invisible? So %a1 says Barbarian helped them? I think we can handle them, for they are heavily dependent on our armor supplies. I'll talk to the head of their guild, while you can do away with those rascals, assassins. Kill 'em all. Here is a string for 30 ears. I hope it'll be all ears when I see you next time. %m1.
10505 Fine, %p1. I haven't wasted my time either and barbarians have admitted they took part in that operation. %m2 is alive and kept in custody in a dungeon. According to barbarians, he's been tortured and revealed the secret of the Ring. The secret was communicated to %z1, a half-human who was once a member of our guild, but was expelled with ignominy for treason. He now serves Assassins and he is quite able to make the Ring. He must be found and destroyed as soon as possible! %m1. 
10506 %z1 is destroyed, but %m2 is still in the hands of Assassins. Learning about %z1's death, they made him work for them. The ring may now be ready. Set %m2 free urgently! %m1.
10507 You are just on time, %p1. I've just finished my job and should you come later, the ring would be in the hands of Assassins. Take it and bring it to %m1. I've suffered enough because of it. %m2.
