100 a large bag or back-pack - is the usual "companion" of an experienced traveler. It is quite expensive and that is why adventurers - those of the poorer kind - would normally carry a small bag. A large bag, sewn by a skilled master, is usually made of thick leather, which is why it not only protects the load from rain, but would also cover the back from a light blow. A large bag can hold about 12 different items - such as, say, pouches for magic powder or a neatly folded chainmail. The bag has only one disadvantage - one cannot carry more than one of them at a time.
