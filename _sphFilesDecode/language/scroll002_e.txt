01 Manuscript of the Unicorn
03 Manuscript of the Unicorn

TEXT
        A Unicorn is a strange creature that appeared in the Sphere after the beginning of the Transformations some 5-6 millennia ago. The Unicorn spends the larger part of its life in between-worlds and is thus invisible. Only at times would its path bring the Unicorn into one world or another. Once a year the Unicorn would drop its horn that also remains in between-worlds. The horn is used to make invisibility rings. Many centuries ago Noviz, the Master of the Hall of the Remaining, managed to find the horn using a world quake. The horn was simply shaken out of the between-worlds and into the Sphere, and the quake left a dead meadow after itself. Later they started using the Rester Fern to find the horn. With the help of a Magic Eye, that is made of fern and quartz, one can detect the horn and pull it into their own world.

    Nylus of Nomrad, Master of Magic, Court Alchemist, and Historian of His Royal Majesty Leon the Second, King of the Sphere, Duke of Charon, Ruler of the Six Continents.
